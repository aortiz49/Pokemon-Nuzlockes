Alpha Sapphire Nuzlocke Rules 

*Welcome to a Pokémon Alpha Sapphire Nuzlocke!*


1. *Catching pokemon*
   1. The nuzlocke begins as soon as you receive pokeballs from your mother
   2. You get one catch attempt per route
   3. If you fail to catch the pokemon you do NOT get another try on this route.
   4. Duplicate clause. If you encounter a pokemon you have already caught, then you get to mulligan.
      1. You can mulligan indefinitely as long as you don't violate the rules above.
   4. Shiny clause. If you encounter a shiny you can catch it and use it as any of your other pokemon. It must follow all the other rules of the nuzlocke.
2. *If a Pokemon faints…*
   1. If a Pokemon faints it dies. It must be released or boxed indefinitely.
      1. I like creating a Graveyard box in the terminal
3. *You must nickname all Pokemon*
   1. Give them love, become attached, cry when they die.
4. *White/blackout is game over*
   1. It doesn’t matter if you have more pokemon in your boxes
   2. As long as you win the battle with at least one pokemon you can withdraw more pokemon from your bank and keep going.
5. *PokeSlots*
   1. The number of Pokemon you can have in your party is determined by the number of badges you have
      1. 0 badges = 2 slots
      2. 1-2 badges = 3 slots
      3. 3 badges = 4 slots
      4. 4 badges = 5 slots
      5. 5+ badges = 6 slots
   2. You can swap out your pokemon at any time using your pokemon bank link
6. *Level Cap*
   1. The level cap for your Pokemon equals the highest level pokemon of the next gym leader
      1. As soon as a pokemon hits the level cap it is boxed until the gym challenge
